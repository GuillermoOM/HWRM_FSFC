This is the remaster of an existing and abandoned mod for Homeworld Remastered based of the Freespace series of games.

## What happened to the original mod?

The main issue was with one of the updates for Homeworld Remastered that modified the way the HODs worked, the internal structure of the files changed, so the game isn't able to load old versions of HOD files anymore (which is the case of the current mod on steam). With the mod abandoned by it's creator, it was left unplayable.

## How do you play this mod?

Simply clone the repo to your machine, preferrably on the main /Homeworld/ game directory, then modify the launch parameters of the game to something like:

```
-moddatapath HWRM_FSFC\source
```

Launch the game, no matter which version of homeworld RM you choose (1 or 2), it will load the mod.
